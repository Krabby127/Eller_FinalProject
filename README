The following is Michael Eller's Project (In Progress)

COMMANDS:
    <Left-Click + MOUSE>: drag Xwing
    <SPACE>:              reset Xwing to center of screen
    <ESC>:                Exit program

INSTALL:

Most of the structure is leftover from the full github repo
The following tools are required to make/run the project
    -cmake
    -build-essentials
    -zlib
    -libxi

Run the following commands to acquire all necessary packages
    $sudo apt-get update
    $sudo apt-get install cmake
    $sudo apt-get install build-essential
    $sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev
    $sudo apt-get install zlib-bin
    $sudo apt-get install libxmu-dev libxi-dev
    $cmake CMakeLists.txt -DASSIMP_BUILD_SAMPLES=1
    $cmake CMakeLists.txt -G 'Unix Makefiles'
    $make
    $sudo make install
    $cd samples/SimpleOpenGL
    $make

See site for further instructions (clanlib.org/assimp-linux.htm) if needed
Tested from a fresh install of Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS

RUN:
    $cd bin
    $./assimp_simpleog
Click and drag mouse to move Xwing Fighter around window (cursor is hidden)

Additional Notes:
    This was my first time actually working with a library of this
    magnitude before. This presented many obstacles for me, such as
    figuring out how to use CMake to even compile and link the necessary
    files, thoroughly understanding what the provided example code was
    doing, and espicially reading through countless pages of documentation.
    Some things that I am proud of in this project are actually being able 
    to properly load my 3d image, being able to properly move the spacecraft
    around using the mouse (which was much harder than I imagined it to be),
    and the little touches I added near the end of the project to add just
    a little bit of pizzazz. The space ship has a slight idling motion
    to make it appear more alive. In addition, a second light source is
    placed near the large star present in the skybox to make it appear
    more realistic. I was so close to getting the ability to load
    multiple spacecraft, but the "scene" structure used by assimp was
    very difficult to comprehend (much less manipulate). Given more time,
    there are dozens of features I would have loved to add to my project,
    but nonetheless, I am proud of what I have accomplished. 

    Thank You,
    Michael Eller
